## Scenarios

### Setting up your darc client

The darc client is a .NET Core global tool.  It requires that a .NET Core SDK be
installed globally on the machine. The client can be installed using the
`eng\common\darc-init.ps1` script located under any arcade enabled repository.
The version of the tool that will be installed will match the version of the Maestro++
service at the time of the installation.

#### Step 1: Install the darc client (from scripts in any arcadified repository):
```
D:\repos\arcade> .\eng\common\darc-init.ps1
  Attempting to install 'sdk v9.0.100-preview.4.24267.66' from public location.
dotnet-install: Extracting the archive.
dotnet-install: Adding to current process PATH: "D:\repos\arcade\.dotnet\". Note: This change will not be visible if PowerShell was run as a child process.
dotnet-install: Note that the script does not resolve dependencies during installation.
dotnet-install: To check the list of dependencies, go to https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/windows#dependencies
dotnet-install: Installed version is 9.0.100-preview.4.24267.66
dotnet-install: Installation finished
Tool 'microsoft.dotnet.darc' (version '1.1.0-beta.24304.4') was successfully uninstalled.
Installing Darc CLI version 1.1.0-beta.24306.2...
You may need to restart your command window if this is the first dotnet tool you have installed.
'D:\repos\arcade\.dotnet\dotnet.exe' tool install microsoft.dotnet.darc --version 1.1.0-beta.24306.2 --add-source 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet-eng/nuget/v3/index.json' -v minimal -g
You can invoke the tool using the following command: darc
Tool 'microsoft.dotnet.darc' (version '1.1.0-beta.24306.2') was successfully installed.
```

If you get a `SecurityError` saying that `\eng\common\darc-init.ps1` cannot be loaded because running
scripts is disabled on this system, you can relax your `ExecutionPolicy` for this script:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File .\darc-init.ps1
```

After your client is installed, you should be able to launch it by typing 'darc'
on the command line. If this is the first global tool you've installed, you may
need to first restart your command window.

```
D:\repos\arcade> darc
Microsoft.DotNet 1.1.0-beta.19081.1+270fa76db13d4c103a6dec2b03f1fd79730ff429

  delete-channel               Deletes an existing channel.

...
```

#### Step 2: Authentication:
Darc talks to the Maestro API which requires authentication.
Devs on the .NET team should have access to it through the "all FTE" security group. You can test this by running `darc get-channels` or by visiting [https://maestro.dot.net/](https://maestro.dot.net/).
If you don't have access (because you are not part of the .NET team directly), request the access to https://coreidentity.microsoft.com/manage/Entitlement/entitlement/dotnetesmaes-z54r.

#### Step 3: Set additional PATs for Azure DevOps and GitHub operations

When executing most operations, the client needs to make some remote queries.
These remote queries require authentication in most circumstances. There are 3
PATs that may be used:
- **[Required]** A GitHub PAT for downloading files from GitHub (e.g. `eng/Version.Details.xml` or
  arcade script files. No scopes required but token must be [SSO enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on) for all organizations for which repositories `darc` will be used.
- **[Optional]** An Azure DevOps PAT for downloading files from Azure DevOps. (e.g.
  eng/Version.Details.xml). When not provided, local system credentials are used. Required scopes: Code-Read, Build-Read & Execute, Packaging Read.
  The recommended way of generating the PAT is using the [PatGeneratorTool](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_artifacts/feed/dotnet-eng/NuGet/Microsoft.DncEng.PatGeneratorTool),
  with the `dotnet pat-generator --scopes build_execute code --organizations dnceng devdiv --expires-in 180` command
- *[DEPRECATED] A Build Asset Registry (BAR) password for interacting with Maestro++/BAR (e.g.
  obtaining build information needed for a drop). This one is no longer needed and you can sign-in through browser when using darc.*

> [!NOTE]
>  [PatGeneratorTool](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_artifacts/feed/dotnet-eng/NuGet/Microsoft.DncEng.PatGeneratorTool) can be installed with the following command
> ```
> dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.DncEng.PatGeneratorTool --add-source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet-eng/nuget/v3/index.json --prerelease
> ```

These tokens can either be passed on the command line using parameters (see [Parameters](#parameters)), or
cached locally on the machine using the [`darc authenticate`](#authenticate) command.

After supplying your secrets, a simple `darc get-channels` operations should succeed.

```
D:\repos\arcade> darc get-channels
.NET Tools - Latest
.NET Engineering Services - Int
.NET Engineering Services - Prod
.NET Tools - Validation
.NET Core 3 Release
.NET Core 3.1 Dev
.NET Core 3.1 Release
.NET 5 Dev
.NET Core 3.0 Internal Servicing
.NET 3 Tools
.NET 3 Tools - Validation
```

*Note: `darc get-channels` does not exercise all authentication paths which require PAT's.  If you run a darc command and see an error like `Response status code does not indicate success: 401 (Unauthorized)`, it likely indicates that you are missing an AzDo or GH PAT (or that one of those PAT's is invalid / expired).*


### Adding dependencies to a repository

Adding a new dependency to a repository means adding a dependency that is
tracked by the Maestro++/darc system. This dependency's version can then be automatically updated,
along with its sha and repository uri. It can contribute to the repository
dependency graph, and the build producing it will be included in a drop.

Dependencies are tracked in eng/Version.Details.xml, along with the following
information about each one:
- Name
- Source sha
- Source repository
- Is the dependency version pinned (can be it automatically updated?)
- Dependency type (toolset or product)

The [`darc add-dependency`](#add-dependency) command adds a new dependency.  It takes a number of
parameters, though only `--name` and `--type` are initially required.  It is
highly recommended at least the `--repo` parameter be provided so that the
sha/version data can be filled in using [`darc update-dependencies`](#update-dependencies). See [Toolset
vs. Product Dependencies](#toolset-vs-product-dependencies) below for
information on type. For example:

```
darc add-dependency --name 'Microsoft.NETCore.App' --type 'product' --repo https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup
```

This will add a new dependency called 'Microsoft.NETCore.App' to eng/Version.Details.xml under the
product section. The version, repo, and sha information will be left blank.  A
corresponding PropertyGroup entry in eng/Versions.props will be added, with the same
version number. The property name is derived off of the dependency name, with
the .'s and -'s removed and "PackageVersion" added onto the end. *Note: If
eng/Versions.props's existing version property names end with the suffix
'Version', darc will append that instead.*

eng/Versions.props after add command.
```
<MicrosoftNETCoreAppPackageVersion></MicrosoftNETCoreAppPackageVersion>
```

After doing this, you can use the generated `MicrosoftNETCoreAppPackageVersion`
property as inputs to a PackageReference element or wherever else may need a
version number.

After adding, it is recommended that you use darc to fill out the missing
dependency information.  The information can also be filled in after committing by Maestro++
using dependency flow, but passing your CI without a filled-in version number
may be difficult. See [Updating dependencies in your local repository](#updating-dependencies-in-your-local-repository)

#### Toolset vs. Product Dependencies

There are two types of dependencies: 'Product' and 'Toolset'. Choosing between
them involves answering the question:

"Does my repository repackage the input dependency's binaries, or information
about those binaries in the outputs it creates for the product?" If so, that
dependency is 'Product', otherwise, it's 'Toolset'.

Some examples:

##### Toolset
- **Arcade SDK or other arcade packages** - These packages are not customer
  facing and do not ship as part of the product.
- **dotnet/corefx's dependency on Microsoft.NETCore.App** - This is a circular
  dependency for testing purposes.

##### Product
- **dotnet/core-setup's dependency on dotnet/coreclr's runtime packages** - Even though
  these packages are not 'shipped' to nuget.org, they are repackaged by dotnet/core-setup.
- **dotnet/core-sdk's dependency on dotnet/core-setup** - The SDK repackages
  information about Microsoft.NETCore.App.
- **dotnet/winforms's dependency on dotnet/corefx's outputs** - Winforms repackages
  information about the dotnet/corefx api surface area, and thus those dotnet/corefx binaries
  should be 'shipped'.  While we wouldn't necessarily want to ship multiple
  versions of the same binary in a release, we would ensure that the same dotnet/corefx
  version is coherent across the stack.

### Updating dependencies in your local repository

Sometimes it may be useful to update the dependency state of your local
repository against the latest builds. This might be useful when:
- Manually updating to create a new PR.
- Filling out missing information (e.g. version and sha) in Version.Details.xml
  prior to committing a new dependency.
- Updating to the latest binaries on a different channel for testing.

darc reads the Version.Details.xml file and notes the dependency name and
repository uri of each dependency.  Then, given an input channel, it looks up
the latest build of each dependency's repository that has been applied to the
channel. It then updates the Version.Details.xml and other version files (e.g.
Versions.props) based on the newest information.

Continuing with the example from [Adding dependencies to a
repository](#Adding-dependencies-to-a-repository), let's say I just added a
dependency on Microsoft.NETCore.App out of core-setup. I want to fill in the
missing information prior to check-in.  I know that the channel that .NET 5
day to day development for core-setup targeting is '.NET 5 Dev', so by
doing:

```
PS C:\enlistments\arcade> darc update-dependencies --channel ".NET 5 Dev" --name "Microsoft.Netcore.app"

Updating 'Microsoft.NETCore.App': '' => '3.0.0-preview-27401-3' (from build '20190201.3' of 'https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup')
  Dependency name normalized to 'Microsoft.NETCore.App'
Local dependencies updated from channel '.NET 5 Dev'.

Alternately, let's say I'm working on updating to the latest arcade, which has a
change I need to react to.  I check out a branch locally off of master, then run
update-dependencies against the tools channel ('.NET Tools - Latest') to pull in the latest script files:

### Removing dependencies from a repository

Removing a dependency from a repository involves simply removing the appropriate
`Dependency` block from eng/Version.Details.xml and committing. At that point, neither darc nor
Maestro++ will know anything about it any longer.

### Changing a dependency's type

To change a dependency's type, move the `Dependency` element from the
parent `ProductDependencies` element into `ToolsetDependencies` (or vice versa)
and commit.  See [Toolset
vs. Product Dependencies](#toolset-vs-product-dependencies)

### 'Pinning' dependencies so they do not update.

By default on each operation (e.g. subscription updates or `darc
update-dependencies`), darc and Maestro will update all applicable dependencies
in eng/Version.Details.xml and associated files.  For instance, if a
subscription from core-setup's '.NET 5 Dev' channel to core-sdk's master
branch produces 3 outputs, Maestro will attempt to update any matching inputs in
core-sdk's eng/Version.Details.xml file. In some cases, it may be necessary to
pin dependencies so they do not move (e.g. if a breaking change requires
extended work).

This is possible by adding a Pinned="true" attribute to the dependency
information.  If Pinned is not supplied, the default is "false".

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

### Coherent parent dependencies

Coherent parent dependencies are a way to relate two dependencies within your
repository. A dependency with a coherent parent will update its version based on
the version of the dependency that appears within the subtree of the coherent
parent. This essentially keeps the dependency from moving 'ahead' of another
dependency in your repo.

![Coherent Parent Diagram](CoherentParent.png)

This is most typically used when referencing corefx, coreclr, and core-setup
outputs. Microsoft.NETCore.App encodes information about the corefx and
coreclr runtime binaries that it has as dependencies itself.  Repositories
downstream may need to take dependencies on both Microsoft.NETCore.App as well
as specific corefx packages. If the corefx packages move ahead of what is
referenced in Microsoft.NETCore.App, issues may occur. Specifying a coherent
parent that ties the corefx dependencies to Microsoft.NETCore.App will avoid
this.

The *subtree of the coherent parent* is the tree of builds that the parent
depends on, including transitive dependencies. To perform a coherent parent
update, Darc searches the assets in the subtree to find the newest-built asset
matching the dependency that declared the coherent parent. Darc then assigns
that version to the dependency.

### Strict Coherency

This current default model of coherency (find the newest-built asset) has some severe
drawbacks:
- **Build information is required** - The current algorithm picks the newest build asset
  in the subtree. This means that a build lookup is required for each every build in the tree.
  This is not only time consuming, it is also fragile. Loss of BAR data would mean that
  CPD constraints could not be satisfied.
- **Newest may not be the desired choice** - More than one version of the asset may appear
  within the subtree. While newest is chosen, this does not mean that newest is the correct
  choice. Consider the following:
  - dotnet/efcore ties dependency Foo to Bar, coming from dotnet/extensions. Foo is produced
    out of dotnet/core-setup.
  - dotnet/extensions has Foo pinned to version 1.0.0, but also has dependencies on
    another, newer dotnet/core-setup build that also produced Foo at 1.0.1.
  - CPD will choose Foo to be 1.0.1. This may be what the repo owner wished, but they may
    also simply have wanted 1.0.0.
- **Incremental servicing can cause version regressions** - This is perhaps the biggest drawback
  of the current algorithm. Consider the following:
  - dotnet/efcore ties dependency Foo to Bar, coming from dotnet/extensions. Foo is produced
    out of dotnet/core-setup, but only when it has changes for an upcoming release.
  - dotnet/extensions does not have a direct dependency on Foo.
  - dotnet/extensions has a dependency on another incrementally-serviced package produced out of
    dotnet/core-setup. This package has not been serviced recently, but when it was, Foo was also serviced,
    producing 1.0.3.
  - dotnet/core-setup just serviced Foo @ 1.0.10, but for the next release it is not producing that
    package.
  - When dotnet/core-setup build is ingested into dotnet/efcore and dotnet/extensions
    for the next release, the CPD algorithm will no longer find Foo @ 1.0.10 in the build asset
    graph. It has simply disappeared because there is no longer a reference to any build
    that produced Foo @ 1.0.10. Instead, it will find 1.0.3, as this reference still exists.

Strict coherency eliminates these problems by doing the following: If dependency Foo is tied to
coherent parent Bar, and Bar comes from dotnet/extensions @ 12345, then dotnet/extensions @ 12345
must have a **direct** dependency on Foo. The version of Foo is directly copied from the version
at dotnet/extensions @ 12345. This ensures the following:
- No build information is utilized and the CPD evaluation only involves a single version file
  lookup.
- There is no choice to make. There is only one possible version for Foo, since a dependency
  can only appear once within a Version.Details.xml file.

The downside of CPD strict is that dependencies that are not directly utilized within a
repo are often required to appear in their Version.Details.xml files. Overall, this is
a small tradeoff for better performance and predictable behavior. Rollout of CPD strict
as the default behavior is pending addition of new dependencies in various repos in the 3.x
branches.

To try CPD strict on a repo, run the following command:

```
darc update-dependencies --strict-coherency --coherency-only
```

#### Specifying a coherent parent

To specify a coherent parent, add "CoherentParentDependency" attributes in your
Version.Details.xml file, as shown below:

```
PS D:\enlistments\extensions\eng> cat .\Version.Details.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!--

  This file is used by automation to update Versions.props and may be used for other purposes, such as
  static analysis to determine the repo dependency graph.  It should only be modified manually when adding
  or removing dependencies. Updating versions should be done using the `darc` command line tool.

  See https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/Darc.md for instructions on using darc.

### Adding dependency flow

Dependency flow is the automatic movement of dependency information between
repositories. This is done by Maestro++ keeping track of new builds in each
repository and opening PRs in other repositories when those repositories' input
dependencies in eng/Version.Details.xml match the outputs of the new builds.

These updates are selective and based on 'subscriptions'. A subscription describes an update
operation for a specific repository+branch combination, mapping outputs of a
repository that have been applied to a channel (virtual branch) onto matching
inputs of the target repository+branch.

For example, a build of dotnet/corefx might be applied to the ".NET 5 Dev"
channel. dotnet/core-setup maps new outputs of dotnet/corefx on the ".NET 5 Dev"
channel onto its master branch.

A subscription has a few parts:
- Mapping of source repo + source channel => target repo + target branch
- An update rate (e.g. every day, every build, not at all)
- Whether a subscription is batchable or not. If batchable, all batchable
  subscriptions targeting the same repo+branch combination will share a PR.
  *Note: Batchable subscriptions is currently only supported by the REST API.
  Please contact @dnceng to set up batchable subscriptions.*
- A set of auto merge policies, if the subscription is not batchable.  If batchable,
  merge policies are set on a repository level rather than a per-subscription
  level, as they end up shared between several subscriptions. *Note: repository
  merge policies are currently unsupported in darc. Please contact @dnceng to
  set up repository merge policies.*

For additional information and samples, see [add-subscription](#add-subscription)

#### When should a subscription be used to update my repository's inputs?

Whenever you want regular dependency flow between two repositories. For example,
every day (when there is a new source build) or on every new build.

#### What input channel should be used?

There are generally two channels for day to day use in .NET 5:
- '.NET 5 Dev' - Day to day builds of .NET 5 repositories are placed on
  this channel.
- '.NET Tools - Latest' - Arcade releases are placed on this channel.

So, if you're not adding a dependency on the https://github.com/dotnet/arcade
repo, the source channel should be '.NET 5 Dev'. If you have other specific
needs, contact @dnceng.

### Halting and restarting dependency flow

Sometimes it's necessary to halt dependency flow into or out of a repository for
a period of time. While there are lots of cases where this might be done, here
are some typical examples:
- **Shutting down changes for a release** - The 'last' build of a repository
  like corefx has been produced, and now needs to propagate to the many places
  in the repository graph it is referenced.
- **A change in another repository has a breaking change** - Because Maestro++
  can auto-merge PRs, a breaking change that isn't caught by CI might be
  continually propagated as it is the 'latest' build.
- **A specific, isolated dependency of a specific repository needs to be kept at
  a specific version** - A few dependencies of a repository should be kept at a
  specific version, while the rest are allowed to update.

darc and Maestro++ have a few mechanisms to enable such scenarios:

- **Disabling or deleting a default channel association** - By disabling a
  default channel association for a repo, no new builds of that repo will be
  automatically assigned to the targeted channel.  This effectively halts
  dependency flow without altering all the subscriptions sourcing from that
  repository.  Furthermore, if a selective fix needs to be flowed, the build
  containing that fix can be selectively assigned to correct channel and the
  existing subscriptions will flow as normal.

  Today this can only be done by either deleting or disabling an existing
  default channel association. Examples:

  Pausing new flow from aspnet/Extensions:

  ```
  # Disable by repo+branch+channel

  darc default-channel-status --disable --repo https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions --branch refs/heads/master --channel ".NET 5 Dev"

  # Disable by id.
  # Use get-default-channels to get the ID of the default channel association,
  then use default-channel-status to disable.

  darc get-default-channels

  # Find id of association in list
  (63)   https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions @ refs/heads/master -> .NET 5 Dev

  darc default-channel-status --disable --id 63
  ```

  Resuming flow from aspnet/Extensions:

  ```
  ```
- **Disabling or deleting a subscription** - By disabling or deleting a
  subscription, flow between two specific points can be halted.  For instance,
  if arcade has a breaking change that passed core-setup's CI, then it may be
  necessary to remove flow temporarily while the issue is dealt with.  Today,
  this is only possible via the command line tool by deleting the subscription,
  then recreating it when normal flow should be resumed:

  Pausing new flow from arcade to core-setup

  ```
  PS C:\enlistments\arcade> darc get-subscriptions --source-repo arcade --target-repo core-setup

  https://github.com/dotnet/arcade (.NET Tools - Latest) ==> 'https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup' ('master')
  - Id: 21e611eb-ab71-410e-ca98-08d61f236c94
  - Update Frequency: everyDay
  - Merge Policies:
    AllChecksSuccessful
      ignoreChecks =
                     [
                       "WIP",
                       "license/cla"
                     ]
  - Last Build: N/A

  PS C:\enlistments\arcade> darc delete-subscriptions --id 21e611eb-ab71-410e-ca98-08d61f236c94
  Successfully deleted subscription with id '21e611eb-ab71-410e-ca98-08d61f236c94'
  ```

  Resuming flow:

  ```
  PS C:\enlistments\arcade> darc add-subscription --channel '.NET Tools - Latest' --target-repo https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup
                            --target-branch master --update-frequency everyDay --all-checks-passed
                            --source-repo https://github.com/dotnet/arcade --ignore-checks 'WIP,license/cli'

  Successfully created new subscription with id '689a946e-2c12-4b0c-ccf6-08d688804ce4'.
  ```
- **Pinning specific dependencies** - Specific dependencies can be pinned when
  they should not move.  This keeps the dependency from moving without altering
  subscriptions or channels. This is useful when only a **subset** of a
  specific repos dependencies should not move.

  To do this, add a `Pinned="true"` attribute to the dependency that should not
  move.
  ```
  PS C:\enlistments\arcade> cat .\eng\Version.Details.xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <Dependencies>
    <ProductDependencies>
      <Dependency Name="Microsoft.NETCore.App" Version="3.0.0-preview-27401-3" Pinned="true">
        <Uri>https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup</Uri>
        <Sha>b50554ac9a96fedc8580fa6090b6e9e75a23193b</Sha>
      </Dependency>
    </ProductDependencies>
  ```
  Resume flow by removing the attribute or setting its value to "false".
'
### Viewing the dependency graph

The dependency graph is the transitive set of dependencies defined by the data in Version.Details.xml.
Each dependency listed contains information on the source of the dependency,
specifically which repository and sha it was generated from. Visiting that repository
at the specified sha will yield another set of dependencies. Transitively
visiting these repository+sha combinations will build up a repository graph. The
graph may have cycles, and the transitive walk is stopped at those nodes.  It
may also be stopped at any toolset dependency unless those are specifically
included with `--include-toolset`.

For detailed information on generating the dependency graph, see
[`get-dependency-graph`](#get-dependency-graph).

#### How to interpret incoherencies

Incoherencies in the graph are places where the same repo appears twice with
different shas, or the same dependency appears twice at different versions (even
if it was sourced from the same sha).  Incoherencies are caused by multiple
paths to the root node that run through the same repository, combined with
different flow rates between repositories, varying graph depth, build breaks, etc.

Incoherencies aren't necessarily bad. During most of the development cycle, the
graph is highly incoherent.  What matters is whether those incoherencies will
produce semantic differences in behavior. This is something that can generally only be
interpreted by developers/product owners by looking at the substantive
differences.  The default position for day to day development is that
incoherencies are not a big deal, but the default position for a shipping
product is that non-toolset incoherencies should be removed.  This can be done
by halting dependency flow after "final" builds are done of incoherent repos.
See [Halting and restarting dependency
flow](#halting-and-restarting-dependency-flow) for some options here.

For a rough example, let's say that at the end of the shipping cycle core-setup
flows its 'last' build to core-sdk and other repos.  The graph stabilizes.
Then, at the last moment, they make a test only fix and check it in.  It flows
to core-sdk quickly, but gets held up in the other repos that pull
Microsoft.NETCore.App due to them not taking any new PRs.  This certainly counts
as an incoherency, but because there is no semantic product difference between
the two versions in the graph there may be no harm in shipping with that
incoherency.

### Gathering a build drop

Gathering a drop of the product or subpiece part of the product is a typical
activity done by developers, release automation, etc.  The darc tool can do this
using the Build Asset Registry information alongside the dependency graph
information.

A build drop is a gathering of all the outputs of a specific build that were
reported to the Build Asset Registry into a local location. Optionally, this
build drop may also include any builds that were inputs to this build, based on
the dependency information in Version.Details.xml. Builds produce various
outputs that go to various locations. For example, they may produce NuGet
packages, zips, MSIs, etc. These may be available in the build artifacts, or may
be located in various storage accounts.  Gather-drop mines the Build Asset
Registry for these locations and downloads them all to the local directory.

The drop is generally divided into two sections: shipping and non-shipping.
Shipping dependencies are those that must be visible to customers.  Non-shipping
dependencies are those that generally serve as inter-repo transport.  Some
examples:
- Packages shipping to nuget.org - Shipping
- Coreclr transport packages - Nonshipping, since they get repackaged by
  core-setup
- Symbols - Shipping, since they go to symbol servers

#### What can I gather a drop for?

You can gather either an isolated or full (includes dependencies) drop for any
build in the repository graph. Since the major components of the .NET Core stack
are rooted at 3 different repositories, gathering a drop of those repositories
will generate a drop for those 3 components and any of their inputs if `--full`
is supplied.
- https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk - SDK
- https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore - ASP.NET Core
- https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup - Runtime.

#### How do I find the root build for a drop?

`gather-drop` must be able to find a root build. This root build today is
identified by either a repo+sha combo or a direct BAR build ID. For most
repositories that build on every commit, providing the repo uri and latest sha
will generate a drop:

```
PS C:\enlistments\core-sdk> git rev-parse HEAD
465a336c7a5ca3af2f6cf5172ddc0ebde620803b
PS C:\enlistments\core-sdk> darc gather-drop --repo https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk
                            --commit 465a336c7a5ca3af2f6cf5172ddc0ebde620803b --output-dir C:\scratch\drop
...
```

If no build exists at that drop, darc will show an error. In this case, you
might try other recent shas, or use the BAR swagger API
(https://maestro.dot.net/swagger) to look up a build
id. Remember to authenticate using a token from
https://maestro.dot.net/.  Better methods of obtaining
the root build are coming soon.

The root build can then be provided using --id

```
PS C:\enlistments\core-sdk> darc gather-drop --id 1234 --output-dir C:\scratch\drop
```

### Assigning an individual build to a channel

Builds are assigned to channels in one of two ways:
- A default channel
- Manually adding the build to the channel

A default channel is a note that says that every build of a repo on a specific branch should apply
to that channel. This is useful because repositories generally do not change the purpose of some of their
branches over time. For instance, core-setup's release/3.1 branch will like apply to servicing releases
of .NET Core 3.1 forever. When a default channel is present, the necessary publishing steps will take place
at the end of the build and assignment to the channel will take place once those are successful. Default
channels can be added with the [add-default-channel](#add-default-channel) command.

There is also a way to assign one-off builds to a channel. This can be useful if builds only ocassionally
apply to a channel, or if a default channel assocation was missed prior to a build being launched. This command
launches a pipeline which performs the standard publishing steps using the build's artifact inputs, and then
assigns the build to the specified channel. To run this command you need your darc client configured with an AzDO
PAT which can launch builds, as well as the standard GitHub PATs.  See
[Setting up your darc client](#setting-up-your-darc-client) for more information.

The default use case is shown below. The ID is the BAR build ID, which can be found in the Publish Build Assets
task of the "Publish to Build Asset Registry" job in your build. See
[Locating the BAR build ID for a build](#locating-the-bar-build-id-for-a-build).

```
darc add-build-to-channel --id 46856 --channel ".NET Core SDK 3.1.3xx"
```

There are a few interesting non-standard scenarios:
- If you don't want to publish you can pass: `--skip-assets-publishing`. The build will immediately apply
  to the new channel. You should only do this if you know the assets from this build are already available
  to downstream builds.
- By default, the publishing pipeline will use the same version of arcade that was referenced in the build
  you wish to assign. This may not be desirable if your repo is missing a required arcade fix. You can ask
  for the automation to use a different arcade version by passing `--source-branch` and `--source-sha`. These
  are the source branch and sha of arcade, not your repo. For instance, the following command will use arcade
  at sha `09bb9d929120b402348c9a0e9c8c951e824059aa` in context of branch master (this is required by AzDO, but not
  particularly material to the functionality.)
  ```
  darc add-build-to-channel --id 46856 --channel ".NET Core SDK 3.1.3xx" --source-branch master
    --source-sha 09bb9d929120b402348c9a0e9c8c951e824059aa
  ```

### Locating the BAR build ID for a build

To locate the BAR build ID for a build
1. Look for the **Publish to Build Asset Registry** job in your build.
2. Find the Publish Build Assets task
3. Look in the logs for that task, and note the build id:
  ```
  D:\a\1\s\.dotnet\sdk\5.0.100-preview.1.20154.9\MSBuild.dll /nologo -maxcpucount /m -verbosity:m ...
    You are using a preview version of .NET Core. See: https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-preview
    Starting build metadata push to the Build Asset Registry...

    Determined build will be added to the following channels: [131]
  ```
4. The BAR build ID is `47814`

### Checking Merge Policies on Github

You will find them on the `Checks` tab of each updates PRs created by maestro. Depending on the merge policies set for the repository, you will find one or multiple check(s) (in a failed or successful state). 

![Checks Merge Policies](ChecksMergePolicies.png)


## Command Reference

### **`Parameters`**

All darc command have a `--help` option that lists and describes all of their parameters

### **`add-channel`**

Add a new channel. This creates a new tag that builds can be applied to.

*This is not a typical operation and you should consult with the (`@dnceng`)
engineering team before doing so.*

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade> darc add-channel --name "Foo"

Successfully created new channel with name 'Foo'.
```

### **`set-goal`**

Sets a goal build time for the definition per channel in minutes. Only dnceng is in scope. This is captured for the [Power BI dashboard](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_dashboards/dashboard/40ac4990-3498-4b3a-85dd-2ffde961d672). 

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade> darc set-goal --minutes 38 --definition-id 6 --channel ".Net 5 Dev"

38
```

### **`get-goal`**

Get the goal build time for a definition per channel in minutes. Only dnceng is in scope. This is captured for the [Power BI dashboard](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_dashboards/dashboard/40ac4990-3498-4b3a-85dd-2ffde961d672)

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade> darc get-goal --definition-id 6 --channel ".Net 5 Dev"

38
```


### **`add-dependency`**

Add a new tracked dependency to the Version.Detail.xml file in your local repo.
This dependency is also added to eng/Versions.props as well as global.json (for certain
dependencies, such as the Arcade SDK). This new dependency can then be updated using
[update-dependencies](#update-dependencies). After merging the changes into
the remote github or AzDO repository, the dependency can be updated by Maestro++
if there is a corresponding subscription targeting that repo.

When adding a new dependency, only name and type are required.  For a detailed
discussion on adding new dependencies to a repository, see [Adding dependencies to a repository](#adding-dependencies-to-a-repository)

**Sample**

*eng\Version.Details.xml* before running add:

```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade> cat .\eng\Version.Details.xml

### **`add-default-channel`**

Adds a new default channel mapping.  A default channel maps each new build of a specific
branch of a repository onto a specific channel. While builds can be selectively
and manually applied to channels, this is generally inconvenient for day to day development
in most cases.  In general, until release shutdown, each build of a branch
should always be applied to its "normal" channel.

***Note that the branch specified should almost always be
"refs/heads/{branchName}", unless you explicitly know otherwise***.

This is because the BAR reporting functionality pulls the branch name from the
Azure DevOps built in pipeline variables, which specify refs/heads/foo vs. foo.
If your repository is manually reporting to BAR without using the Arcade
templates, then this name may be different.

Default channel mappings can be deleted with [delete-default-channel](#delete-default-channel).

**Sample**
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade> darc add-default-channel --channel ".Net 5 Dev" --branch refs/heads/master --repo https://github.com/dotnet/arcade
```

### **`add-subscription`**

Adds a new subscription to Maestro++.

There are two types of subscriptions: dependency flow and code flow subscriptions.

Information about code flow subscriptions can be found at [Codeflow-PRs](UnifiedBuild/Codeflow-PRs.md)

A  dependency flow subscription describes an update
operation for a specific repository+branch combination, mapping outputs of a
repository that have been applied to a channel (virtual branch) onto matching
inputs of the target repository+branch.

For example, a build of dotnet/runtime might be applied to the ".NET 9"
channel. dotnet/sdk maps new outputs of runtime on the ".NET 9"
channel onto its main branch.

A subscription has a few parts:
- Mapping of source repo + source channel => target repo + target branch
- An update rate (e.g. every day, every build, not at all)
- Whether a subscription is batchable or not. If batchable, all batchable
  subscriptions targeting the same repo+branch combination will share a PR.
- A set of auto merge policies, if the subscription is not batchable.  If batchable,
  merge policies are set on a repository level rather than a per-subscription
  level, as they end up shared between several subscriptions. *Note: repository
  merge policies are currently unsupported in darc*

`add-subscription` has two modes of operation:
- Interactive mode (default) - Interactive mode will take whatever input parameters were
  provided on the command line (if any) and pop an editor where the user can
  provide the subscription input parameters.
- Command-line only mode (`-q`) - In this mode, the full set of input options must be
 supplied.

Upon saving and closing the editor, or running the darc command if in command
line mode (`-q`), the darc tool submits the new subscription to Maestro++. If
successful, the id of the new subscription is returned.

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade-services> darc add-subscription --channel ".NET Tools - Latest"
                                   --source-repo https://github.com/dotnet/arcade
                                   --target-repo https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-optimization
                                   --target-branch master --update-frequency everyDay --all-checks-passed -q

Successfully created new subscription with id '4f300f68-8800-4b14-328e-08d68308fe30'.
```

**Available merge policies**

- Standard - This is the recommended merge policy. It encompasses two existing
  merge policies:
  - All PR checks must be successful, ignoring typical checks in GitHub in AzDO
    that do not indicate the quality of the PR (e.g. the WIP check) as well as a
    check that no changes have been requested on the PR. For codeflow subscriptions,
    it also adds additional validation for version files.

  YAML format for interactive mode:
  ```
   - Name: Standard
  ```

- AllChecksSuccessful - All PR checks must be successful, potentially ignoring a
  specified set of checks. Checks might be ignored if they are unrelated to PR
  validation. The check name corresponds to the string that shows up in GitHub/Azure DevOps.

  YAML format for interactive mode:
  ```
   - Name: AllChecksSuccessful
     Properties:
       ignoreChecks:
       - WIP
       - license/cla
       - <other check names>
  ```

- RequireChecks - Require that a specific set of checks pass. The check name
  corresponds to the string that shows up in GitHub/Azure DevOps.

  YAML format for interactive mode:
  ```
   - Name: RequireChecks
     Properties:
       checks:
       - MyCIValidation
       - CI
       - <other check names>
  ```

- NoExtraCommits - If additional non-bot commits appear in the PR, the PR should not be merged.

  YAML format for interactive mode:
  ```
   - Name: NoExtraCommits
  ```

### **`add-build-to-channel`**

Adds an existing build to a channel.

Much of the time, builds are automatically added to channels with default
channel associations (See [add-default-channel](#add-default-channel)).
Occasionally, automatic assignment is turned off for various reasons but we may
still need to assign a specific build to a channel.

This can be done with the `add-build-to-channel` command.  It takes two
parameters:
- Name of the channel you want to assign a build to
- BAR build id of the build to assign to the specified channel. This can be
  found by looking at the "Publish to Build Asset Registry" leg of an official build.

**Sample**
```

darc add-build-to-channel --id 65256 --channel ".NET 6 Dev" --publishing-infra-version 3

Waiting '60' seconds for promotion build to complete.

Build '65199' was successfully added to the target channel(s).
Assigning build '65199' to the following channel(s):
	.NET 6 Dev

Repository:    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime
Branch:        master
Commit:        0e30f6fdc3ba5e1ef7ffb952fcb4762e5041c491
Build Number:  20200921.2
Date Produced: 9/21/2020 1:08 PM
Build Link:    https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=823133
BAR Build Id:  65199
Released:      False
Channels:
The following repos/branches will apply this build immediately:
  https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-wpf-int @ master
The following repos/branches will apply this change at a later time, or not by default.
To flow immediately, run the specified command
  https://github.com/dotnet/ef6 @ master (update freq: EveryDay)
    darc trigger-subscriptions --id 9e51514d-a37b-46b2-d464-08d76e1d3434

```
### **`authenticate`**

Set up your darc client so that the PAT or password inputs do not need to be
passed on each command invocation.  This command opens up an editor form with
various password settings. These values are overridden by the `--password`,
`--bar-uri`, `--azdev-pat` and `--github-pat` settings common to all commands.

See [Setting up Your Darc Client](#setting-up-your-darc-client) for more
information.

**Sample**
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade> darc authenticate

(opens in editor)

# Create new BAR tokens at https://maestro.dot.net/Account/Tokens
bar_password=***
# Create new GitHub personal access tokens at https://github.com/settings/tokens (no auth scopes needed)
github_token=***
# Create new Azure Dev Ops tokens at https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/_details/security/tokens (code read scope needed)
azure_devops_token=***
build_asset_registry_base_uri=https://maestro.dot.net/

# Storing the required settings...
# Set elements above depending on what you need

```

### **`clone`**

Clone a remote repo and all of its dependency repos. This is typically used for source build purposes.

### **`default-channel-status`**

Enables or disables a default channel association. Default channels associations
that are disabled will not apply to new builds. This effectively turns off flow
out of the repository. Builds may still be applied manually to any channel.
using [add-build-to-channel](#add-build-to-channel).

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc get-default-channels --source-repo core-setup --branch release/3.0
(192)  https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup @ refs/heads/release/3.0 -> .NET Core 3 Release

PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc default-channel-status --disable --id 192
Default channel association has been disabled.

PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc default-channel-status --enable --id 192
Default channel association has been enabled.
```

### **`delete-channel`**

Delete a channel. This channel must not be in use by any subscriptions.

*This is not a typical operation and you should consult with the (`@dnceng`)
engineering team before doing so.*

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade> darc delete-channel --name "Foo"

Successfully deleted channel 'Foo'.
```

**See also**:
- [add-channel](#add-channel)
- [get-channels](#get-channels)

### **`delete-default-channel`**

Deletes a default channel mapping. Deleting will not affect any existing builds,
but new builds of the specified repos will not be applied to the target
channel.

You can obtain a list of current default channel mappings with
[get-default-channels](#get-default-channels)

- `--channel` - **(Required)** Name of channel that builds of 'repository' and 'branch' should not apply to.
- `--branch` - **(Required)** Repository that should have its default association removed.
- `--repo` - **(Required)** Branch that should have its default association
  removed.

**Sample**
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade> darc delete-default-channel --channel ".Net 5 Dev" --branch refs/heads/master
                          --repo https://github.com/dotnet/arcade
```

**See also**:
- [add-default-channel](#add-default-channel)
- [get-default-channels](#get-default-channels)

### **`delete-subscriptions`**

Deletes a specified subscription by its id. This removes the subscription from
Maestro and no new updates based on the subscription will be created. Any
updates currently in progress will not be closed, but will not auto-merge.  To
obtain the id of a subscription to be deleted, see [get-subscriptions](#get-subscriptions).

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade-services> darc delete-subscriptions --id 4f300f68-8800-4b14-328e-08d68308fe30

Successfully deleted subscription with id '4f300f68-8800-4b14-328e-08d68308fe30'
```

### **`gather-drop`**

Gathers a build drop of a repository into a local directory.

A build drop is a gathering of all the outputs of a specific build that were
reported to the Build Asset Registry into a local location. Optionally, this
build drop may also include any builds that were inputs to this build, based on
the dependency information in Version.Details.xml. Builds produce various
outputs that go to various locations. For example, they may produce NuGet
packages, zips, MSIs, etc. These may be available in the build artifacts, or may
be located in various storage accounts.  Gather-drop mines the Build Asset
Registry for these locations and downloads them all to the local directory.

`gather-drop` operates in two modes: normal and full.  In normal mode, only the
outputs for the desired build (the 'root' build) are downloaded.  In full mode,
the tool will then look up the dependency version information for the sha that
was built, then find the builds that created those inputs. The same is done
until all potential nodes are visited. Traversal will break when a cycle is
reached, when a node has no additional dependencies, or when the dependencies it
has are only toolset and `--include-toolset` has not been supplied.

The output directory structure is as follows:
  - All outputs will be downloaded under the root folder, in either a 'shipping'
  or 'nonshipping' folder  (if `--nonshipping`
  is passed and the build contains non-shipping binaries). Under these
  folders will be two additional folders: 'assets' and 'packages'. Assets
  contains all non-package outputs, while 'packages' contains all NuGet packages.
  - Each repository in the build structure will be placed in a separate directory,
  with the ID of the build under that directory. Under each build will be a
  'shipping' folder and potentially a 'nonshipping' folder (if `--nonshipping`
  is passed and the build contains non-shipping binaries). Under these
  folders will be two additional folders: 'assets' and 'packages'. Assets
  contains all non-package outputs, while 'packages' contains all NuGet
  packages.
  - A manifest file will be generated under the root folder containing information about all gathered builds

**Sample**:

### **`get-channels`**

Retrieves a list of channels. Channels are something like a virtual cross
repository branch. They are a tag that is applied to a build which indicates the
purpose of the outputs of that build. Channels are used as sources in a
subscription, indicating that the repository wants dependency updates from
builds meant for the purpose associated with the channel.

For instance, there is a channel called `.NET 5 Dev`. Builds that appear on
this channel are intended for day to day .NET 5 development. Repositories
may have dependencies on other .NET Core repositories when building their own
part of the .NET 5 stack. By subscribing to that repository's `.NET 5
Dev` channel, they map .NET 5 daily development outputs onto their own
target branch.

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade> darc get-channels

.NET Tools - Latest
.NET Engineering Services - Int
.NET Engineering Services - Prod
.NET Tools - Validation
.NET Core 3 Release
.NET Core 3.1 Dev
.NET Core 3.1 Release
.NET 5 Dev
.NET Core 3.0 Internal Servicing
.NET 3 Tools
.NET 3 Tools - Validation
```

### **`get-default-channels`**

Retrieves a list of default channel mappings. A default channel maps each new build of a specific
branch of a repository onto a specific channel. While builds can be selectively
and manually applied to channels, this is generally inconvenient for day to day development
in most cases.  In general, until release shutdown, each build of a branch
should always be applied to its "normal" channel. The internal ID of the default
channel association is also presented for convenience with other operations like
[default-channel-status](#default-channel-status).

**Sample**
```
PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc get-default-channels --channel ".NET Core 3 release"

### **`get-dependencies`**

Retrieves the dependencies listed in the local repo. This command reads the
Version.Details.xml file from the local repository and prints out the relevant
information.  By default, the command lists all dependencies.

For information on toolset vs. product dependencies, see [Toolset vs. Product
Dependencies](#toolset-vs-product-dependencies)

**Sample**
```
PS C:\enlistments\arcade-services> darc get-dependencies

```

### **`get-dependency-graph`**

Given a starting repository and sha, builds the full repository dependency
graph.

The dependency graph is defined by the dependencies in Version.Details.xml.
Each dependency listed contains information on the source of the dependency,
specifically which repository and sha it was generated from. Visiting that repository
at the specified sha will yield another set of dependencies. Transitively
visiting these repository+sha combinations will build up a repository graph. The
graph may have cycles, and the transitive walk is stopped at those nodes.  It
may also be stopped at any toolset dependency unless those are specifically
included with `--include-toolset`.

The graph output comes in 3 forms:
- (Default) A full textual graph representation indicating all involved repositories,
  their input dependencies, and the repositories that created those input
  dependencies.
- A 'flat' graph where only unique repository+sha combinations are shown. The
  individual package dependencies are ignored.
- A graph-viz text format that can be used to generate a visual presentation of
  the graph.

In flat and full modes, after printing the graph, a set of "incoherencies" and
the paths to those incoherences are displayed. Incoherencies are cases where either:
- The same repository exists in the graph at two different shas
- The same input dependency exists in the graph at two different versions.
  While generally this also leads to the same repository existing multiple times
  in the graph at different shas, it's also possible for the same sha to be
  built more than once, producing different package versions.

  While by default, this command uses remote resources to generate the graph,
  it's possible to generate if you have all potential input repositories
  available in a folder with all the necessary shas downloaded.  In this mode,
  starting from the root repository, darc will scan the folder for git repos
  that contain the input shas to that repository. It will then build up the
  dependency graph based on that information.

  By default, if no parameters are passed, the head sha of the current
  repository is used as the starting point.

**Sample**

```

### **`get-flow-graph`**

Get dependency flow graph in graphviz form. This graph represents inter-repository flow vs.
[get-dependency-graph](#get-dependency-graph) which represents current
repository inter-dependencies. This visualization can be useful to understand
the flow of changes in between repositories. Pictorial graphs can be generated
using dot.exe or other GraphViz tools.

**Sample**
```
PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc get-flow-graph --channel "3 Rel"

### **`get-health`**

Evaluate the dependency flow-related health of the .NET Core repositories,
channels, etc. `get-health` evaluates a number of metrics (e.g. cycles in
dependency flow).  Each metric either passes, fails, or generates warnings.

**Sample**
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade-services> darc get-health --channel ".NET Core 3 Release"

### **`get-latest-build`**

Retrieves the latest builds matching the specified criteria. If more than one
build matches then multiple builds are returned. This is useful for a quick
check of what the latest build of a repository is, especially if it has not been assigned to a channel.

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade-services> darc get-latest-build --repo core-setup --channel ".NET 5 Dev"
Repository:    https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup

### **`get-repository-policies`**

Retrieves information about repository merge policies. Merge policies dictate
the checks that must be satisfied for a pull request to be automatically merged.
These merge policies come from two sources:
- Non-batchable subscriptions specify their own merge policies.
- Batchable subscriptions share a merge policy per repo+branch combination.

**Sample**:
```
S D:\enlistments\websdk> darc get-repository-policies --repo extensions
Filtered 3 policies for branches not targeted by an active batchable subscription. To include, pass --all.

https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions @ master
- Merge Policies:
  Standard
https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions @ release/3.0-preview6
- Merge Policies:
  Standard
```

- [set-repository-policies](#set-repository-policies)
- [add-subscription](#add-subscription)

### **`get-subscriptions`**

Retrieves information about existing subscriptions. This command is generally
useful to determine what kind of dependency flow will happen on new builds, or
to obtain the id of a subscription for use in
[delete-subscriptions](#delete-subscriptions).

The top line of the listing shows the subscription mapping and is read:
```
https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore (.NET 5 Dev) ==> 'https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk' ('master')

Builds of https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore that have been applied to channel ".NET 5 Dev" will be applied to the master branch of https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk.
```

If no parameters are specified, `get-subscriptions` will show a full list of
Maestro++ subscriptions. This list can be filtered by various input parameters
to be more useful.

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade-services> darc get-subscriptions --target-repo core-sdk --source-repo aspnet

https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore (.NET 5 Dev) ==> 'https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk' ('master')
  - Id: 510286a9-8cd5-47bd-a259-08d68641480a
  - Update Frequency: EveryBuild
  - Enabled: True
  - Batchable: False
  - Merge Policies:

    Standard
```

### **`set-repository-policies`**

Set merge policies for the specific repository and branch. These policies only
apply to batchable subscriptions. When all repository policies are satisfied,
the dependency update pull request is automatically merged.

If -q is not passed, the command pops up a edit dialog so that the repository
policies may be edited.

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc set-repository-policies --repo https://github.com/dotnet/corefx --branch master --standard-automerge -q
Successfully updated merge policies for https://github.com/dotnet/corefx@master.

PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc get-repository-policies --repo https://github.com/dotnet/corefx --branch master --all
https://github.com/dotnet/corefx @ master
- Merge Policies:
  Standard
https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab @ master
- Merge Policies: []
```

- [get-subscriptions](#get-subscriptions)
- [add-subscription](#add-subscription)

### **`subscription-status`**

Enables or disables a subscription matching the id. You can find out whether a
subscription is disabled or enabled using get-subscriptions.

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc subscription-status --id 1abbb4c1-19d8-4912-fab8-08d6a19aff91 --disable
Successfully disabled subscription with id '1abbb4c1-19d8-4912-fab8-08d6a19aff91'.

PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc get-subscriptions --source-repo aspnetcore --target-repo websdk --channel Dev
https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore (.NET 5 Dev) ==> 'https://github.com/aspnet/websdk' ('master')
  - Id: 1abbb4c1-19d8-4912-fab8-08d6a19aff91
  - Update Frequency: EveryDay
  - Enabled: False
  - Batchable: False
  - Merge Policies:

PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc subscription-status --id 1abbb4c1-19d8-4912-fab8-08d6a19aff91 --enable
Successfully enabled subscription with id '1abbb4c1-19d8-4912-fab8-08d6a19aff91'.

PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc get-subscriptions --source-repo aspnetcore --target-repo websdk --channel Dev
https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore (.NET 5 Dev) ==> 'https://github.com/aspnet/websdk' ('master')
  - Id: 1abbb4c1-19d8-4912-fab8-08d6a19aff91
  - Update Frequency: EveryDay
  - Enabled: True
  - Batchable: False
  - Merge Policies:
    Standard
```

### **`trigger-subscriptions`**

Triggers one or more subscriptions. For each subscription triggered, Maestro++ will create a new PR or update an existing one into the repo to update to the latest build (or specified build, if one is provided), regardless if the build had been applied previously or not.

This update is not asynchronous and usually takes a few minutes, as Maestro++ needs
to do a fair bit of work in the background.  New PRs created by
trigger-subscriptions have `dotnet-maestro[bot]` as their author.

Like get-subscriptions, `trigger-subscriptions` takes a number of input parameters
to filter the available subscriptions to the desired set, though at least one
input must be specified. Unless `-q, --quiet` is specified, darc will ask for
confirmation before sending the trigger request.

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\arcade> darc trigger-subscriptions --source-repo arcade --target-repo arcade-services

Will trigger the following 1 subscriptions...
  https://github.com/dotnet/arcade (.NET Tools - Latest) ==> 'https://github.com/dotnet/arcade-services' ('master')
Continue? (y/n) y
Triggering 1 subscriptions...done

PS D:\enlistments\arcade> darc trigger-subscriptions --source-repo arcade --target-repo arcade-services --build 123
Subscription updates will use Build # 123 instead of latest available
Will trigger the following 1 subscriptions...
  https://github.com/dotnet/arcade (.NET Tools - Latest) ==> 'https://github.com/dotnet/arcade-services' ('master')
Continue? (y/n) y
Triggering 1 subscriptions...done
```

### **`update-dependencies`**

Updates the local repository's dependencies against a channel.

This operation is similar to what a Maestro++ subscription does, only local.
darc reads the Version.Details.xml file and notes the dependency name and
repository uri of each dependency.  Then, given an input channel, it looks up
the latest build of each dependency's repository that has been applied to the
channel. It then updates the Version.Details.xml and other version files (e.g.
Versions.props) based on the newest information.

This command has two additional non-default modes:
- Use a local package folder as input, avoiding a remote call to the
build asset registry (--packages-folder)
- Update a specific dependency to a new version (--name and --version)

This command is especially useful after adding new dependencies to a repository.
See [Updating dependencies in your local
repository](#updating-dependencies-in-your-local-repository) for more
information.

**Sample**
```
PS C:\enlistments\core-setup> darc update-dependencies --channel ".NET 5 Dev"

### **`update-subscription`**

Update an existing subscription. Opens an editor so that some properties of a
subscription may be altered. Because of the way that Maestro++ tracks pull
requests, the *target* parameters of a subscription (target repository and
target branch) may not be edited.

**Sample**:
```
PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc get-subscriptions --source-repo aspnetcore --target-repo websdk --channel Dev
https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore (.NET 5 Dev) ==> 'https://github.com/aspnet/websdk' ('master')
  - Id: 1abbb4c1-19d8-4912-fab8-08d6a19aff91
  - Update Frequency: EveryDay
  - Enabled: True
  - Batchable: False
  - Merge Policies:
    AllChecksSuccessful
      ignoreChecks = []

PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc update-subscription --id 1abbb4c1-19d8-4912-fab8-08d6a19aff91
Successfully updated subscription with id '1abbb4c1-19d8-4912-fab8-08d6a19aff91'.

PS D:\enlistments\websdk> darc get-subscriptions --source-repo aspnetcore --target-repo websdk --channel Dev
https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore (.NET 5 Dev) ==> 'https://github.com/aspnet/websdk' ('master')
  - Id: 1abbb4c1-19d8-4912-fab8-08d6a19aff91
  - Update Frequency: EveryDay
  - Enabled: True
  - Batchable: False
  - Merge Policies:
    Standard
```

- [add-subscription](#add-subscription)

### **`verify`**

Verifies the local repository state is valid.  This checks that:
- The Version.Details.xml file is readable and in the expected format.
- The Versions.props file is in an appropriate xml format.
- The global.json file is in the expected format.
- Dependencies in the Version.Details.xml files are utilized in the
  Versions.props or global.json files.
- Version numbers match between Version.Details.xml and corresponding
  expression of those dependencies in Versions.props/global.json

**Sample**
```
PS C:\enlistments\core-setup> darc verify
Dependency verification succeeded.
```

### **`initialize`**

Initializes new repo(s) that haven't been synchronized into the VMR yet. The new repo(s) should be added to source-mappings.json before using this command

**Sample**
```
darc vmr initialize -r --source-mappings <path to source mappings> arcade-services
```

### **`backflow`**

Flows source code from the current commit of a locally checked out VMR into a target local repository. Must be called from
the VMR directory.

**Sample**
```
darc vmr backflow C:\Path\Repo
```

### **`cherry-pick`**

Cherry-picks a single commit from a repository to/from the VMR. The command automatically detects whether it's being called
from a VMR or repository folder (based on the existence of `src/source-manifest.json`) and applies the appropriate flow direction.

When called from the VMR:
- Creates a patch from the specified commit in the VMR's `src/{mapping}` folder
- Applies the patch to the target repository

When called from a repository:
- Creates a patch from the specified commit in the repository
- Applies the patch to the VMR's `src/{mapping}` folder

The mapping name is automatically determined by parsing the `Version.Details.xml` file's `Source` section.

**Sample**
```
# Cherry-pick from VMR to repository (when called from VMR)
darc vmr cherry-pick --source C:\Path\TargetRepo --commit abc123def

# Cherry-pick from repository to VMR (when called from repository)
darc vmr cherry-pick --commit abc123def --source C:\Path\VMR
```

### **`forwardflow`**

Flows source code from the current commit of a local repository into a local VMR. Must be called from the local repository
folder.

**Sample**
```
darc vmr forwardflow C:\Path\VMR
```
### **`generate-tpn`**

Generates a new THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt.

**Sample**
```
darc vmr generate-tpn --tpn-template C:\Path\VMR\tpn-template.json --vmr C:\Path\VMR
```

### **`get-version`**

Gets the current version (a SHA) of a repository in the VMR.

**Sample**
```
darc get-version --vmr C:\Path\VMR
```

### **`push`**

Pushes given VMR branch to a given remote.
Note: this command was used prior to onboarding repos onto flat flow to push newly updated vmr branches from AzDo agents to their remotes.

**Sample**
```
darc vmr push --remote-url https://github.com/myfork/dotnet --branch main --skip-commit-verification
```

### **`reset`**

Resets the contents of a VMR mapping to match a specific commit SHA from the source repository, effectively restoring the mapping to a known good state. This command takes a single parameter in the format `[mapping]:[sha]`.

**Sample**
```
# Reset runtime mapping to specific commit
darc vmr reset runtime:abc123def456
# Invalid format - shows clear error
darc vmr reset invalid-format
# Output: fail: Invalid format. Expected [mapping]:[sha] but got: invalid-format
```

### **`diff`**

Diffs the VMR and the product repositories. Outputs the diff to stdout or saves it to a patch file (or multiple if patch > 1 GB), if --output-path is provided.
If input repos are not local, they'll be cloned locally and cleaned up afterwards, so the command might not be instant.

**Sample**
```
darc vmr diff C:\Path\VMR..https://github.com/dotnet/runtime:main
```

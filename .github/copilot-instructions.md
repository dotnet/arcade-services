- Rules apply to our C# code.
- Use function-reflective, descriptive names without implementation details.
- For multi-task methods, use descriptive names and document the process.
- Long method names are acceptable.
- Async methods must have an "Async" suffix.
- Avoid using booleans solely to signal success, unless failure is an expected frequent outcome (e.g. TryGet methods).
- Do not return null unless explicitly indicated (e.g., TryCreate).
- Validate early; if validation fails, throw or return immediately.
- After validation, use if/else—not returns—for control flow.
- Keep methods focused; split them if too large.
- Use immutable objects (e.g., records, readonly properties) when possible.
- Never throw generic Exceptions.
- Use structural logging consistently.
- Each method should log its own actions.

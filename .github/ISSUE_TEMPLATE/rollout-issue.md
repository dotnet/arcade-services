# Purpose

This issue tracks the `arcade-services` repository rollout. It provides the person responsible for the rollout checklist of the steps that need to be performed to rollout services in this repository. All relevant information, including the rollout PR, issues encountered during the rollout and steps taken to resolve them should be linked or added to this issue to keep full audit trail of changes rolled out to production.

# Process

## Build status check
- [ ] Check the status of the [dotnet-arcade-services-weekly](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=993) pipeline
- [ ] Check the status of the [arcade-services-internal-ci](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=252) pipeline.

## Rollout preparation
- [ ] Create the rollout PR:
  - Find a commit on `main` that you want to rollout
  - Create a branch named `rollout/YYYY-MM-DD` from that commit
  - Create a PR on GitHub from the `rollout/YYYY-MM-DD` branch to `production`
  - Name the PR `[Rollout] Production rollout YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Link this issue in the PR description
- [ ] Merge the prepared rollout PR (⚠️ **DO NOT SQUASH**)
- [ ] Verify that a `production => main` PR was opened in `arcade-services` with the rollout merge commit ([example](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade-services/pull/2741)). There should be no changes in the PR to any files. **Do not merge the PR yet**.
- [ ] Ensure the build is green and stops at the `Approval` phase

## Rollout
- [ ] Approve the `Approval` stage of the rollout build.
- [ ] Monitor the rollout build for failures.

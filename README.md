# Arcade Services

## Overview

This repo is home of the services that help us construct .NET. Mainly, you can find the **Product Construction Service** (previously *Maestro*) dependency flow system and the Darc CLI tool.

The service's main responsibility is opening and managing dependency update pull requests in .NET repositories. It is also responsible for [the code flow subscription between product repositories and the VMR](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Full-Code-Flow.md).

## Development

See instructions on how to run the code [here](docs/DevGuide.md).

## Filing issues

### License

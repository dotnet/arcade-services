⚠️⚠️⚠️ PLEASE READ ⚠️⚠️⚠️

This is a servicing branch which contains the Darc tool only. It is not intended to be used for development but only to support servicing of the VMR-lite (.NET 8.0 Virtual Monolithic Repository).  
The .NET 9.0 VMR synchronization process differs wildly so this branch contains a frozen version of the tooling used for 8.0 flows.

The Darc tooling built in this branch is only used in the [`release/8.0` branch of `dotnet/installer`](https://github.com/dotnet/installer/tree/release/8.0.1xx).

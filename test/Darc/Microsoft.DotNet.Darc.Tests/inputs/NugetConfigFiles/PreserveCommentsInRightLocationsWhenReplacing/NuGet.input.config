<!-- This test case exercises being called with a different darc-pub-* feed
     Expected behaviors:
       - <clear> tag honored at beginning of packageSources
       - 'Begin: Package sources' and 'End: Package sources' comments are left alone outside of added feeds
       - darc-pub-dotnet-corefx-4ac4c03 is removed replaced with a different feed (darc-pub-dotnet-standard-a5b5f2e)
       - arcade is removed, and standard added for public feeds.
       - 'Begin: Package sources from ...' and 'End: Package sources from ...' comments created around each dotnet-standard's feed
       - Feeds are added in alphabetic order
       - A multi-line comment is included in the file and expected to not change its conte
       - Disabled Sources node is created, but is empty because the feeds added are darc-pub feeds and don't need to be disabled.

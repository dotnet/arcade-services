<!-- This test case exercises being called with a nuget config with no managed packageSources comment blocks and no feeds
     Expected behaviors:
       - <clear> tag honored at beginning of packageSources
       - 'Begin: Package sources' and 'End: Package sources' comments created outside of added feeds
       - 'Begin: Package sources from ...' and 'End: Package sources from ...' comments created around each repo's feeds
       - Feeds are added in alphabetic order
       - Disabled Sources node is created, but is empty because the feeds added are darc-pub feeds and don't need to be disabled.

<!-- This test case exercises the same scenario as the one in 'AddFeedsToNuGetConfigWithoutManagedFeeds' except the input file purposefully only has Begin tags for Maestro managed sources block and a repo.
     Expected behaviors:
       - <clear> tag honored at beginning of packageSources
       - 'Begin: Package sources' and 'End: Package sources' comments created outside of added feeds
       - 'Begin: Package sources from ...' and 'End: Package sources from ...' comments created around each repo's feeds
       - Feeds are added in alphabetic order
       - Disabled Sources node is created, but is empty because the feeds added are darc-pub feeds and don't need to be disabled.
       - Comments end up in a "healthy" state.

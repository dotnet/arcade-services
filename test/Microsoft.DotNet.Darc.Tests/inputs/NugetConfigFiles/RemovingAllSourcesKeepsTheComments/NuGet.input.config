<!-- This test case exercises being called with no managed package sources where there were some defined previously.
     Expected behaviors:
       - All managed source are removed from inside the packageSources block
       - No comments are removed (trying to avoid merge issues), including for the not-updated 'please-leave-this-alone' repo
       - 'darc-' entries that were not part of the update in the disabledPackageSources section are left alone.
       - Disabled Sources outside the comment block are left alone
       - Disabled Sources inside the comment block are removed (since there are no managed sources)

    ///     Strictly speaking, we can't actually determine whether subscriptions are missing or superfluous.
    ///     Subscriptions are simply triggers to update a repository's dependencies based on the outputs produced from a build.
    ///     So whether or not subscriptions are missing is entirely dependent on what the *next* build will produce,
    ///     which is of course, unknowable.
    ///     
    ///     Fortunately, we can make a generally useful approximation by looking at the latest build
    ///     that each subscription flowed, and checking the build outputs from that subscription. If a dependency is not covered
    ///     by any output in the set, then we may be missing a subscription.  If a subscription does not cover any
    ///     dependencies in the repo, then that subscription may be superfluous. If the same dependency is covered by two separate
    ///     subscriptions, then we have a conflict.
    ///     
    ///     The difficulty here is that the because we do not know what the *next* build will produce, this metric is always
    ///     an approximation of future state. But, since what dependencies a repository produces changes relatively infrequently, it's
    ///     a generally good steady state measure.

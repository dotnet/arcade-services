/// <summary>
/// This class is responsible for resolving well-known conflicts that can occur during a backflow operation.
/// The conflicts can happen when backward and forward flow PRs get merged out of order.
/// This can be shown on the following schema (the order of events is numbered):
/// 
///     repo                   VMR
///       O────────────────────►O 
///       │                 2.  │ 
///     1.O────────────────O    │ 
///       │  4.            │    │ 
///       │    O───────────┼────O 3. 
///       │    │           │    │ 
///       │    │           │    │ 
///     6.O◄───┘           └───►O 5.
///       │    7.               │ 
///       │     O───────────────| 
///     8.O◄────┘               │ 
///       │                     │
///
/// The conflict arises in step 8. and is caused by the fact that:
///   - When the backflow PR branch is being opened in 7., the last sync (from the point of view of 5.) is from 1.
///   - This means that the PR branch will be based on 1. (the real PR branch will be a commit on top of 1.)
///   - This means that when 6. merged, Version.Details.xml got updated with the SHA of the 3.
///   - So the Source tag in Version.Details.xml in 6. contains the SHA of 3.
///   - The backflow PR branch contains the SHA of 5.
///   - So the Version.Details.xml file conflicts on the SHA (3. vs 5.)
///   - There's also a similar conflict in the package versions that got updated in those commits.
///   - However, if only the version files are in conflict, we can try merging 6. into 7. and resolve the conflict.
///   - This is because basically we know we want to set the version files to point at 5.

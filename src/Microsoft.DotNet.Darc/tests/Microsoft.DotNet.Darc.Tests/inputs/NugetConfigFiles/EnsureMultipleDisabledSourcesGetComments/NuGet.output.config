<!-- This test case exercises being called with multiple managed package sources where there were some defined previously.
     Expected behaviors:
       - All managed sources provided (test data adds one arcade, one runtime feed) are inserted into packageSources
       - No comments are removed (trying to avoid merge issues)
       - Disabled Sources are added with valid outer block of comments
